# Context: Github Game off

Game Off is an annual game jam celebrating open source created by Lee Reilly in 2012 and sponsored by GitHub. Participants are given the entire month of November to build a game based on a themeâ€“individually or as a team. Inspired by the Global Game Jam, it encourages collaborative game development and promotes the use and sharing of open source software.

This year's theme was *BUG*.
