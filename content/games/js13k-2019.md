# Context: js13k game jam

js13kGames is a game jam competition, focused on creating browser games that are no larger than 13 kilobytes when compressed using ZIP. Participants are not permitted to use external services or libraries, and all assets must also fit within the size limit. Games are programmed in JavaScript and HTML5.

This year's theme was *back*.

# Game: [Playback](https://js13kgames.com/2019/games/playback)

Team: Adrian Lissot.

[Playback](https://js13kgames.com/2019/games/playback) is an ordered platformer game. Press the playback button to see (and hear) how the level must be played, and play it back. Keyboard and gamepads are supported. The freeplay mode lets you play some music with your keyboard. Some song examples (QWERTY) are included. Feel free to share your own !
Tips:
- Press Space, Triangle or Y for level playback
- You can stick to walls
